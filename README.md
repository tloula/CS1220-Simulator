# Digital Logic Simulator

Object Oriented Design w/ C++<br />
Final Term Project<br />

With a circuit vector file and signal timing diagram as inputs, the digital logic simulator outputs the complete circuit simulation to the terminal.

<i>Note: Project should run in a properly configured Visual Studio given the provided Visual Studio Project Files. If Visual Studio throws an "PDB API call failed error", just re-running the project should fix it - I believe this is a bug in Visual Studio.</i><br />
